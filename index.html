                 <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, lemon juice, ginger paste, garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight for better flavor.</li>
                 <li>Heat 4 tablespoons of butter and the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces, discarding any excess marinade, and cook until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
                 <li>In the same pan, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and chopped onions. Saut√© the onions until they turn golden brown.</li>
                 <li>Add garam masala, cumin powder, and coriander powder to the pan and cook for a minute to release the flavors.</li>
                 <li>Add tomato puree to the pan and cook for a few minutes until the oil separates from the sauce and the tomatoes are cooked.</li>
                 <li>Reduce the heat to low, add the heavy cream, and stir well. Cook for a couple of minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
                 <li>Return the cooked chicken to the pan and mix it well with the sauce. Simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                 <li>Crush the dried fenugreek leaves between your palms and add them to the pan. Stir well.</li>
                 <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little water or more cream to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
                 <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</li>
